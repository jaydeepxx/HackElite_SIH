        PL 751, NARENDRA BARLEY 2, GETANJALI (K1149) LAND PREPARATION
        Carry out ploughing 2-3 times properly to make the land weed free. Before sowing crop land must be properly
        prepared smooth till fine tilth. Ploughing should be followed by 2-3 harrowing to conserved moisture in soil.
        The stubbles and roots of earlier crop should be hand-picked up and dash out of the ground as it attracts
        termites.

        <div class="heading1">SOWING</div>
        Time of sowing
        For optimum yield, complete sowing from 15 October to 15 November. If sowing get delayed yield will get
        declined.
        Spacing
        Use row to row spacing of 22.5 cm. In case of delay sowing, use spacing of 18-20 cm.
        Sowing Depth
        Use depth of 3-5 cm for crop under irrigated conditions and 5-8 cm depth for rainfed conditions.
        Method of Sowing
        For sowing use broadcasting and seed drill method.

        <div class="heading1">SEED</div>
        Seed Rate
        Under irrigated conditions, use seed rate of 35 kg/acre and for rainfed conditions, use seed rate of 45 kg/acre.
        Seed Treatment
        To enhance the yield growth seeds should be treated with Bavistin@2 gm/kg to protect it from smut disease. It
        can be treated with Vitavax @2.5 gm/kg to prevent it from covered smut disease. To make seed termites free it
        should be treated with 250 ml Formothion in 5.3 ltr of water.

        Apply fertilizer dose of N:P:K@25:12:6 kg/acre in term of Urea@55 kg/acre, SSP@75 kg/acre and MOP@10 kg/acre.
        Apply full dose of phosphorus and potash at time of sowing as a basal application whereas give nitrogen dose
        before giving pre-sowing irrigation.

        <div class="heading1">WEED CONTROL</div>
        In initial stage of crop, weed control is necessary to obtained good crop growth along with good yield. Broad
        and narrow leaves are two major weeds in barley. To control broad leaf weed, apply post emergence weedicide
        2,4-D@250 gm/100 Ltr of water per acre, 30-35 days after sowing.
        To control narrow leaf weeds use Isoproturon 75%WP@500 gm/100 Ltr of water or Pendimethalin 30% EC@1.4 Ltr/100
        ltr water for one acre.

        <div class="heading1">IRRIGATION</div>
        For barley, two or three irrigation are required during its life cycle. Avoid water stress during jointing,
        booting and heading stage. Moisture stress at this stage will lead to loss in yield. To optimize yield, soil
        moisture levels should remain above 50% of available moisture in the active root zone from seeding to the soft
        dough stage.
        Apply first irrigation at crown root initiation i.e 25 to 30 days after sowing. At panicle emergence stage
        applies second irrigation.

        <div class="heading1">PLANT PROTECTION</div>
        <div class="heading2">Army worm:</div> Young larvae are light green in color they turn in later stage they
        become yellow color. They
        consumed Leaves from the edges or sometime completely. The clusters of egg are present on leaves appearing as a
        cottony or fuzzy. They are cyclic in nature showing 3 to 4 generation.
        <div class="img">
            <img src="images/army_worm.png" alt="" srcset="">
        </div>
        <div class="heading2">Control:</div> Natural way to control armyworm is to allow the natural creatures that can
        parasitize the larvae which
        destroy the crops. Bacillus thuringiensis application is also beneficial for it.

        When the symptoms are noticed take dusting of malathion 5% @10 kg/acre or quinalphos1.5% @250 ml/acre. After
        harvesting remove weeds and stubble.
        <div class="heading2">Stinkbug:</div> The bug is shield in shape and is either green or brown in color having
        yellowish red marking. These
        bugs bring pathogenic organism carrying in their mouth and cause severe infection to the plant. The eggs are
        laid on leaves in the cluster form.
        <div class="img">
            <img src="images/strink_bug.png" alt="" srcset="">
        </div>
        <div class="heading2">Control:</div> To eradicate the stink bug naturally is to eliminate weed all around the
        crops. Permethrin and
        bifenthrin are two pesticides which used carefully kill the pests.
        <div class="heading2">Aphids:</div> These are nearly transparent, soft-bodied sucking insects. When present in
        sufficient numbers, aphids
        can cause yellowing and premature death of leaves. Infestation usually occurs during second fortnight of January
        till crop.
        <div class="heading2">Control:</div> For Aphid, use chrysoperla predators.5-7 thousand/acre or use 50 gm/Ltr
        neem concentrate. In cloudy
        weather infestation of aphid is occurred. Spray with Thiamethoxam or Imidacloprid 60 ml/acre in 100 Ltr of
        water.

        <div class="heading2">Wireworm:</div> They are light brown in color and there larval stage complete within 1-4
        year. It damages seedling
        twist the stem and crown turns white in color.
        <div class="heading2">Control:</div> Post-emergent pesticide is not available for wireworm control. But seed can
        be treated pre-emergent
        Cruiser Maxx which contain Thiamethoxam @ 325 mL/100 kg of seeds.
        Powdery mildew: Grayish white powdery growth appears on the leaf, sheath, stem and floral parts. Powdery growth
        later become black lesion and cause drying of leaves and other parts. The disease infects plants during periods
        of high humidity and cool to moderate temperatures. Low light intensity, which accompanies dry weather and a
        dense crop canopy, favours this disease.
        When incidence of disease is observed, spray with wettable sulphur@2 gm/Ltr of water or Carbendazim@ 200
        gm/acre. In case of high incidence spray with Propiconazole@1 ml/Litre of water.

        <div class="heading2">Stripe/Yellow rust: </div>The ideal growth conditions for yellow rust are temperatures of
        between 8-13째C for spore
        germination and penetration, and 12-15째C for further development and with free water. The yield penalties from
        yellow rust can range from 5% to as high as 30% in high disease pressure scenarios. The pustules of stripe rust,
        which, contain yellow to orange-yellow urediospores, usually form narrow stripes on the leaves.
        <div class="heading2">Control :</div> use rust resistant variety. Follow crop rotation and
        adopt mix cropping pattern.
        Avoid excess use of Nitrogen. When symptoms observed, do dusting of Sulphur@ 12-15 kg/acre or take spray of
        Mancozeb@2 gm/Ltr or spray the crop with Propiconazole (Tilt) 25 EC@1 ml/litre of water.
        <div class="heading2">Flag smut:</div> It is seed borne disease. Infection spread through wind. It is favoured
        by cool, humid conditions
        during flowering period of the host plant.
        Treat the seed with fungicides like carboxin 75WP@2.5 gm/kg of seeds, Carbendazim@2.5 gm/kg seed, Tebuconazole
        @1.25 gm/kg of seed if the disease level in the seed lot is high. If it iand half the recommended dose of
        Carboxin (Vitavax 75WP) @1.25 gm/kg seed) and half the recommended dose of Carboxin (Vitavax 75WP) @1.25 gm/kg
        seed).

        <div class="heading2">Ear head bug:</div> Adults attack crop on milky stage. They feed on emerging panicle and
        produces chaffy grains with
        silky webs. Eggs are of shiny white color and found in cluster with orange hairs. Caterpillars are of brown
        colors with yellow band and minute hairs. Adults are of brownish color having fibrous forewings and yellowish
        hind wings.
        <div class="heading2">Control:</div> To attract adult moth place light traps during day time. Place pheromone
        trap@5/acre at flowering stage
        until panicle stage. In case of severe infestation spray Malathion or Carbaryl@1 gm/Ltr of water.
        Thrips: Mostly observed in dry weather.
        To check severity of thrips incidence, keep blue sticky traps@6-8 per acre. Also to reduce the incidence spray
        Verticillium lecani @ 5 gm/Ltr water.
        2) If incidence of thrips is more, then take spray of Imidacloprid 17.8 SL or Fipronil@2.5 ml/ltr water or
        Acephate 75% WP@2 gm/ltr or do drenching of Thiamethoxam 25% WG@1 gm/ltr of water.

        <div class="heading2">Grass hopper: </div>Nymphs and adults feeds on leaves. Nymphs are of whitish color with
        lines while adults are
        greenish brown in color with lines on body.
        <div class="heading2">Control: </div>After harvesting remove all plant remains and follow proper sanitation,
        cleanliness in the field. Do
        ploughing after harvesting also in summer so that egg present in soil get exposed to sun and thus get destroyed.
        If infestation is observed spray with Carbaryl 50 WP@900 gm/acre.

        <div class="heading1">HARVESTING</div>
        Crop matures at end of March or April depending upon variety use. To avoid over ripening avoid delay in
        harvesting. The right stage for harvesting is when moisture in grain reaches to 25-30%. For manual harvesting
        use serrate edge sickles. Store in dry place after harvesting.

        <div class="heading1">POST-HARVEST</div>
        Use for malting purpose.
