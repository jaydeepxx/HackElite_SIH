        Wheat is grown on 13 percent of the cropped area of India. Next to rice, wheat is the most important food-grain
        of India and is the staple food of millions of Indians, particularly in the northern and north-western parts of
        the country.
        It is rich in proteins, vitamins and carbohydrates and provides balanced food. India is the fourth largest
        producer of wheat in the world after Russia, the USA and China and accounts for 8.7% of the world’s total
        production of wheat.

        <div class="heading1"> LAND PREPARATION</div>
        After harvest of previous crop, the field should be ploughed with disc or mould board plough. Field is
        usually
        prepared by giving one deep plough with iron plough followed by two or three times local plough and
        planking.
        Carried out plough in evening time and kept furrow open whole night to absorb some moisture from dew.
        Planking
        should be done after each plough early in the morning.
        <div class="heading1"> SOWING</div>
        <div class="heading2">TIME OF SOWING</div>
        Wheat must be sown at the optimum time. Delayed sowing causes a gradual decline in the yield of wheat.
        The time
        of sowing is 25 October – November.
        <div class="heading2">SPACING</div>
        For normal sown crop a spacing of 20 - 22.5 cm between rows is recommended. When sowing is delayed a
        closer
        spacing of 15-18 cm should be adopted.
        <div class="heading2">SOWING DEPTH</div>

        The number of irrigations required will vary depending upon soil type, water availability etc. Crown
        root
        initiation and heading stages are the most critical to moisture stress. For dwarf high yielding
        varieties, give
        pre sowing irrigation. For heavy soils, four to six irrigations are required

        whereas for light soils 6-8 irrigations are necessary. Under limited water supply apply irrigation only
        at
        critical stage. When water is available for only one irrigation, then apply at crown root initiation
        stage. When
        two irrigations are available then apply at crown root initiation and flowering stage. Where three
        irrigations
        are possible, 1st irrigation should be given at CRI stage and 2nd at late jointing (boot) and 3rd at
        milking
        stage. CRI stage is most important stage for irrigation. It has been found that each week delay in 1st
        irrigation from CRI stage results in yield reduction of 83-125kg per acre.
        First irrigation should be given 20-25 days after sowing. This is crown root initiation stage and

        stress at this stage will lead to yield loss. At tillering stage within 40-45 days after sowing, apply
        second
        irrigation. Third irrigation within 60-65 DAS at late jointing stage. At flowering stage (within 80-85
        days)
        give fourth irrigation. Fifth irrigation at dough stage (within 100-105 DAS).

        <div class="heading2">Aphids:</div> These are nearly transparent, soft-bodied sucking insects. When present in
        sufficient numbers,
        aphids
        can cause yellowing and premature death of leaves. Infestation usually occurs during second fortnight of
        January
        till crop harvesting.
        For management of Aphid, use chrysoperla predators 5-8 thousand/acre or use 50 ml/Ltr neem concentrate.
        In
        cloudy weather infestation of aphid is occurred. Spray with Thiamethoxam@ 80gm or Imidacloprid 40-60 ml/
        acre in
        100 Ltr of water.

        </div>
        <div class="heading2">Termite:</div> Termites attack the crop at various growth stages, from seedlings to
        maturity. The severely
        damaged
        plants can be easily uprooted and look wilted and dried. In case roots are partially damaged, the plants
        show
        yellowing. To control broadcast 1 Ltr of Chlorpyriphos 20 EC mix with 20 kg sand/acre then applies a
        light
        irrigation.
        <div class="heading2">Flag smut:</div> It is seed borne disease. Infection spread through wind. It is favoured
        by cool, humid
        conditions
        during flowering period of the host plant. Treat the seed with fungicides like carboxyl (Vitavax 75 WP @
        2.5
        gm/kg of seeds), Carbendazim(Bavistin 50 WP)@2.5 gm/kg seed), Tebuconazole(Raxil 2 DS)@1.25 gm/kg of
        seed) if
        the disease level in the seed lot is high. If it is low to moderate, treat the seed with a combination
        of
        Trichoderma viride@4 gm/kg seed and half the recommended dose of Carboxin(Vitavax 75 WP)@1.25 gm/kg
        seed.
        <div class="heading2">Powdery mildew: </div>Greyish white powdery growth appears on the leaf, sheath, stem and
        floral parts. Powdery
        growth
        later become black lesion and cause drying of leaves and other parts. When incidence of disease is
        observed,
        spray with wettable sulphur@2 gm/ Ltr of water or Carbendazim @400gm/acre. In case of high incidence,
        spray with
        Propiconazole@2 ml/ Ltr of water.
        <div class="heading2">Brown rust:</div> It is favoured by warm temperatures (15-30° C) and humid conditions.
        Brown rust is
        characterized by reddish- brown spores that occur in oval or elongated pustules. The disease can develop
        rapidly
        when free moisture is available and temperatures are near 20° C. Successive generations of urediospores
        can be
        produced every 10-14 days if conditions are favourable.
        For control of this disease, follow mixed cropping with suitable crops. Avoid excessive use of Nitrogen
        fertilizer. Spray Zineb Z-78@400 gm/acre or Propiconazole@2ml/Litre of water.
        <div class="heading2">Stripe/Yellow rust:</div> The ideal growth conditions for yellow rust are temperatures of
        between 8-13° C for
        spore
        germination and penetration, and 12-15° C for further development and with free water. The yield
        penalties from
        yellow rust in wheat can range from 5% to as high as 30% in high disease pressure scenarios. The
        pustules of
        stripe rust, which, contain yellow to orange- yellow urediospores, usually form narrow stripes on the
        leaves.
        For control of this disease, use rust resistant variety. Follow crop rotation and adopt mix cropping
        pattern.
        Avoid excess use of Nitrogen. When symptom observed, do dusting of Sulphur @5-10 kg/acre or take spray
        of
        Mancozeb @ 2 gm/Ltr or spray the crop with Propiconazole (Tilt) 25 EC @2 ml / litre of water.
        <div class="heading2"> Karnal bunt:</div> It is seed and soil borne disease. Infection occurs at flowering
        stage. Cloudy weather
        condition
        during spike emergence to grain filling stage of crop leads to development of disease. If the rains
        occur during
        the month of February in north Indian plains (disease-prone areas), the disease is likely to come with
        higher
        severity.
        For control of this disease use karnal bunt resistant varieties. For management of this disease,
        take one spray of Propiconazole (Tilt 25 EC) @2ml/ Ltr of water at ear head emergence stage.
        <div class="heading1">HARVESTING</div>
        Harvesting of high yielding dwarf variety is carried out when leaves and stem turn yellow and become
        fairly dry.
        To avoid loss in yield crop should be harvested before it is dead ripe. Timely harvesting is needed for
        optimum
        quality and consumer acceptance. The right stage for harvesting is when moisture in grain reaches to
        25-30%. For
        manual harvesting use serrate edge sickles. Combines harvester are also available which can do
        harvesting,
        threshing and winnowing of wheat crop in single operation.
        <div class="heading1">POST-HARVEST</div>
        After manual harvesting, dried crops for three to four days on threshing floor so that moisture content
        of grain
        comes down to 10-12% and then threshing is done by trampling bullocks or thresher attached to bullocks.
        Direct
        sun drying and excessive drying should be avoided and the grains should be packed in sound clean gunny
        bags to
        minimize the losses. The Hapur tekka is a cylindrical rubberized cloth structure supported by bamboo
        poles on a
        metal tube base, and has a small hole in the bottom through which grain can be removed. Large scale
        grain
        storage is done in CAP (Cover and Plinth) and silos. To keep away several pest and disease during
        storage, use
        1% malathion solution for disinfection of gunny bags. Properly clean the storage house, remove the
        cracks and
        fill the rat burrows with cement. White wash the storage house before storing grains and spray Malathion
        50 EC @
        3 Ltr/100 Sq. meters. Place the heap of bags 50 cm away from wall and in between the heaps give some
        gaps. Also
        there should be a gap between the roof and the bags.
