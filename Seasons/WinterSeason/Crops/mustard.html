            <h3>GENERAL INFORMATION</h3>      
India is fourth largest contributor of oilseeds and Rapeseed and mustard contributes about 28.6% in total oilseeds production. After soybean and palm oil, it is third important oilseed in world. Mustard seeds and its oil is used for culinary purpose. Young leaves are used for vegetable purpose. Its oil cake is used for feeding cattle.

Mustard-rapeseed groups includes Indian mustard, Brown and yellow sarson, raya and toria crop. Indian mustard is grown in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, UP, Haryana and Gujarat also in some areas of south like Andra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. Yellow sarson is taken as rabi crop in Assam, Bihar, Orissa and West Bengal where as in Punjab, Haryana, UP and Himachal Pradesh it is taken as catch crop. Earlier brown sarson was cultivated in most of the area now its area under cultivation is decreases and replaced by Indian mustard. Brown sarson has two ecotypes Lotni and Toria. Toria is short duration crop sown under irrigated condition. Gobhi sarson is new emerging oilseed, it is long duration crop grown in Haryana, Punjab, and Himachal Pradesh.

            <h3>FERTILIZER</h3>
            

Fertilizer Requirement (kg/acre)
Crop 	UREA 	SSP 	MURIATE OF POTASH
Toria 	55 	50 	On soil test results
Raya and Gobhi Sarson 	90 	75 	10

 

Nutrient Requirement (kg/acre)
Crop 	NITROGEN 	PHOSPHORUS 	POTASH
Toria 	25 	8 	On soil test results
Raya and Gobhi Sarson 	40 	12 	6

 

While preparing field, apply 70 to 120 qtl farm yard manure or well decomposed cow dung in soil. For accurate fertilizer dose, soil testing is necessary. Under irrigated condition for toria crop, apply N:P in ratio of 25:8kg/acre in form of Urea@55kg/acre and Super phosphate@50kg/acre. Apply K dose only when soil show deficiency of it. For raya and gobhi sarson, apply N:P:K in ratio of 40:12:6 kg/acre in form of Urea@90kg, SSP@75kg and MOP@10kg per acre. For rainfed raya crop apply Urea@33kg/acre and Super Phosphate@50kg/acre.
Apply Urea just before pre-sowing irrigation. Under irrigated condition, for toria apply all fertilizer just before sowing and for raya, gobhi sarson, apply half of fertilizer just before sowing and remaining half with first irrigation. For rainfed condition, give all fertilizer just before sowing.

            <h3>WEED CONTROL</h3>
            To control weeds take two to three weeding and two hoeing at interval of two weeks when intensity of weeds is low. To control weeds in Toria crop, do pre-plant incorporation of Trifluralin @ 400ml/200Ltrs of water per acre. For raya crop, give pre-emergence spray of Isoproturon @ 400gm/200Ltr within 2 days of sowing. Or take post emergence spray 25-30 days after sowing.
        </div>
        <div class="content-crops">
            <h3>IRRIGATION</h3>
            Give pre-sowing irrigation before sowing of seeds. For good growth, crop required in general about three irrigation apply at interval of three weeks after sowing. Apply good amount of organic manures in soil, it will help to conserved moisture in soil.

        <div class="content-crops">
            <h3>HARVESTING</h3>
            Crop takes 110 to 140 days to mature, depending variety. Harvest crop when pods turn yellow and seed become hard. To avoid shattering loss carried out harvesting in morning hours. With the help of sickle, cut crops close to ground. After then stacked harvested crops for 7-10 days. After proper drying complete threshing operation.
      </div>
       <div class="content-crops">
           <h3>POST-HARVESTING</h3>
           Cleaned seed must be dried in the sun for 4-5days or till the moisture content comes down to 8 percent. After proper drying of seeds, stored seeds in gunny bags or bin.
