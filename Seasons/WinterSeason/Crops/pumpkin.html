Nutrient Requirement (kg/acre)
UREA
	SSP 	MOP
90 	125 	35


Application of well rotten FYM@8-10tonnes/acre is used before preparation of beds. Fertilizer dose of Nitrogen @40kg/acre in the form of urea @90kg/acre, Phosphorus @20kg/acre in the form of SSP@125kg/acre and Potassium @20kg/acre in the form of MOP@35kg/acre is added. Nitrogen dose is applied in 2 equal splits. First half dose is applied before sowing and then remaining dose of nitrogen is applied as top dressing within one month.
