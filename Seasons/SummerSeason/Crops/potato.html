            <h3>SOWING </h3>
            <h4>Time of sowing </h4>
            Accurate planting time is necessary for obtaining good yield. Best time of planting is when maximum and minimum temperature is from 30-32 °C and 18-20 °C respectively. For early season crop complete sowing from 25th September to 10th October. For medium
            duration crop, sowing should be done in first week of October to third week of October. While for late duration crop, complete sowing from third week of October to first week of November. For spring season, second fortnight of January is best
            time planting.<br>

        <div class="content-crops">
            <h4> Spacing</h4>
            For planting, use distance of 20 cm between tubers and 60 cm between ridges manually or mechanically. Planting distance vary with size of tubers. If diameter of tuber ranges from 2.5-3.5 cm, use planting distance of 60x15 cm where as if diameter of tuber
            is of 5-6 cm, use spacing of 60x40 cm.

            <h4>Sowing Depth</h4>
            Dig a trench of 6-8 inch deep and plant piece of potato with eye pointing up.

            <h4>Method of sowing</h4>
            For sowing, use tractor operated semi-automatic or automatic planter.

            <h3>FERTILIZER</h3>


            Fertilizer Requirement(kg/acre) UREA SSP MURIATE OF POTASH 165 155 40 Nutrient Requirement (kg/acre) NITROGEN PHOSPHORUS POTASH 75 25 25 Apply 200 qtl/acre of Farm Yard Manure or well decomposed cow dung at time of land preparation two weeks before planting.
            For optimum growth, it required Nitrogen@75 kg per acre in form of Urea@165 kg/acre, Phosphorus@25 kg/acre in form of SSP@155 kg/acre and Potash@25 kg/acre in form of MOP@40 kg/acre. Apply 3/4th of nitrogen fertilizer and whole dose of phosphorus
            and potash at time of sowing. Remaining 1/4th dose of nitrogen should be applied after 30-40 days after planting at time of earthing up operation. In case of light soil apply half dose of nitrogen and full dose of P and K at time of sowing
            and remaining half should be apply as top dressing in two time in equal splits at time of earthing up operation.

            <h4>Earthing up</h4>It is necessary to maintain proper aeration, proper soil temperature and moisture in soil for good growth of crop and proper development of tubers. In earthing up soil is drawn up around base of plant to encourage better tuber
            formation. It should be done when plant attained height of 15-20 cm. If required carry out second earthing up two weeks after first earthing up. It can be done manually with hoe or mould board plough or ridger for large areas.

            <h4>>WSF</h4> To promote bulking in Potato, Spray 13:0:45@ 2 kg and 100gm Magnesium EDTA per acre. Add fungicide Propineb@3 gm/ltr of water as prophylactic. To increase number of tubers and size, spray with Humic acid (12%) @ 3 ml+ MAP 12:61:00
            @ 8 gm/DAP @ 15 gm/ltr of water in vegetative stage.

        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>WEED CONTROL</h3>
            Apply Metribuzin 70WP@200gm per acre or Alachlor@2 ltr per Acre before sprouts emergence. Remove weeds with hand in case of low infestation 25days after planting in plain areas and 40-45days in hilly areas when crop attained height of 8-10cm. Usually
            weedicide in potato plant are not required as earthing up operation destroyed almost all weeds. Mulching is also an effective way to minimized weed infestation along with it helps to conserve soil moisture. Paddy straw or farm remains can
            be used for mulching. Remove mulch 20-25days after planting.

        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>IRRIGATION</h3>
            Depending soil moisture present in soil, irrigate field immediately or 2-3 days after planting. Light and frequent irrigation gives best result, avoid flood irrigation as it will cause rot disease. For medium to heavy soils, three to four irrigation is
            required whereas for sandy soils, 8-12 irrigation are necessary. Second irrigation should be done within 30-35days after planting depending on soil moisture. Remaining irrigation should be given as per requirement of soil and crop need. Stop
            irrigation 10-12days before harvesting.

        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>HARVESTING</h3>


            <b>Dehaulming</b>: It is necessary to get virus free seed also it increases size and number of tubers. Dehaulming means cutting of foliage close to ground at fix timing or date. Its timing is varying according to region and also on aphid population.
            In north it is carried out in last week of December. Crop is ready for harvesting when majority of the leaves turn yellow-brown and fall on ground. Harvest crop 15-20days after dehaulming at proper moisture in soil. Harvesting can be done
            by tractor drawn potato digger or manually with help of spade or khurpi. After harvesting potatoes are spread on ground and allowed to dry in shade, keep them in heaps for 10-15days in shade for curing of skin. Remove damaged and rotten tubers.

        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>POST-HARVESTING</h3>
            Do sorting of tubers and remove cut, injured tubers. After sorting grading is done depending upon diameter or size of tubers. Over size tuber are having great demand as they are useful for chips making. Store potato at temperature of 4° to 7°C and relative
            humidity.
