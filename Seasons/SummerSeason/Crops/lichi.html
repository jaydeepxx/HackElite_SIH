            <h4>Sowing Depth</h4>
            Dug pits of 1m x 1m x 1m and expose to sun for some days. Then fill the pit with top soil with 20-25 kg of well decomposed cow dung, 2 kg of bone meal and 300 gm of MOP. After filling sprinkle some water on it. Plant the seedlings in middle of pit.
            <h4>Method of sowing</h4>
            Direct sowing or transplanting method.

            kg of cowdung, Urea@500 gm -1000 gm, SSP@750 gm -1250 gm and MOP@200-300 gm per Tree. For 7-10 year old crop, apply Urea@1000-1500 gm, SSP@1000 gm, MOP@300 -500 gm and Cowdung@40-50 kg per Tree. When crop is above 10 year, apply well decomposed
            cowdung@60 kg, Urea@1600 gm, SSP@2250 gm and MOP@600 gm per Tree.

            <h3>PROTECTION OF YOUNG PLANTS</h3>
            To protect young crops from hot wind in summer and cold waves in winter, plant suitable windbreak trees around litchi plantation upto 4-5 years. Growing of Dhaincha around litchi plantation will protect plant during summer and winter, for that grows dhaincha
            seeds in middle of February. To protect crop from heavy winds grow tall trees seedling like Mango, Jamun etc. around litchi plantation.
        </div>
        <div class="content-crops">
            <h3>IRRIGATION</h3>
            Apply irrigation at all stage of development. At early growth stage frequent irrigation is needed. During summer, apply irrigation twice a week to young plants and once a week for plant older than 4year age. Give irrigation after completing fertilizer
            application. To protect crop from frost injury, apply water at November end or December first week. Fruit development stage is critical for irrigation. At this stage apply irrigation twice a week; it will help to reduce cracking of fruits
            to greater extent.

            <h3>HARVESTING</h3>
            On attaining proper size, shape along with attractive color having TSS to Acid ratio of 12:1, kinnow fruits is ready for harvest. Depending upon variety fruits are generally ready for harvesting in Mid- January to Mid- February. Do harvesting at proper
            time as too early or too late harvesting will give poor quality
        </div>
        <div class="content-crops">
            <h3>INTER-CROPING</h3>
            It is slow growing crop and required about 7-10years to come into commercial bearing. Intercrop can be taken during initial 3-4 years. It will give additional annual income along with enriching the soil and improve soil condition also help in weed control.
            Quick growing plant like peach, plum, kinnow can be taken as intercrop. Also vegetables and pulses are preferred as intercrop. When orchard come into commercial bearing, uproot intercrops. Litchi is cross pollinated and pollination is done
            by insect, honey bees etc. Place 20-25boxes of honey bees per hectare to get proper pollination and fruit sets.

        <div class="cintent-crops">
            <h3>PRUNING AND TRAINING</h3>
            Initially training is needed to give definite shape. But pruning is not much needed for Litchi plants. Light pruning is needed after harvesting of fruits to promote new shoots.
