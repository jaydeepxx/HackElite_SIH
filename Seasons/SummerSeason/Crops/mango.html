            <h3>SOWING </h3>
            <h4>Time of sowing </h4>
            Planting is done in month of August-September also in February - March. Do planting in cool hours of evening. Protect crop from high wind.<br>
        </div>
        <div class="image-responsive"> <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/35/16/40/35164006662c861a17e7a085676c8b96.jpg" width="700" height="300" alt=""></div>
        <div class="content-crops">
            <h4> Spacing</h4>
            For grafted varieties use distance of 9m x 9m and plant them in square system.</div>
        <div class="img-responsive"> <img src="https://www.better-globe-trees.com/images/tree-investment-risks-apple-mango-rows-from-above.jpg" width="700" height="500" alt=""></div>
        <div class="content-crops">
            <h4>Sowing Depth</h4>
            Dug pits of 1x1x1m size at distance of 9x9m one month earlier before planting. Expose them to sun. Fill with mixture of soil, 30 to 40 kg of FYM or Compost and 1 kg single super phosphate.
            <h4>Method of sowing</h4>
            Square and hexagonal planting can be adopted. Hexagonal planting accommodates 15% more plants.
            <h4>Seed treatment</h4>
            Before planting, dip stones in solution of Dimethoate for few minutes. It will protect crop from mango weevils. Seed treatment with Captan fungicide protects seeds from fungal infections.

            <h3>FERTILIZER</h3>


            Fertilizer Requirement (kg/tree) Age of crop (Year) Well decomposed cow dung (in kg) Urea (in gm) SSP (in gm) MOP (in gm) First to three year 5-20 100-200 250-500 175-350 Four to Six year 25 200-400 500-700 350-700 Seven to nine year 60-90 400-500 750-1000
            700-1000 Ten and above 100 500 1000 1000 Nutrient Requirement (kg/acre) NITROGEN PHOSPHORUS POTASH 27 7 30 Mango crop required 27 kg of N, P2O5 about 7 kg and 30 kg of K2O per acre. For crop of 1-3 year old, Apply 5 to 20 kg of well decomposed
            cow dung, 100-200 gm of Urea, 250-500 gm of Single super Phosphate and 175-350 gm of MOP per tree. For 4-6 year old crop apply increased cow dung dose by 25 kg, give Urea@200-400 gm, SSP@500-700 gm and MOP@350-700 gm per Tree. For 7-9 year
            old crop, apply 60-90 kg of well decomposed cow dung, Urea@400-500 gm, SSP@750-1000 gm, MOP@700-1000 gm per tree. For 10 year or above 10 year crop, apply 100 kg of well decomposed cow dung, Urea@400-500 gm, SSP@1000 gm and MOP@1000 gm per
            Tree. Give N and K dose of fertilizer in February month whereas apply whole amount of cow dung and SSP in December month. Sometime changing weather causes fruit and inflorescences drop. If fruit drop is observed to minimize it spray 13:00:45@10gm/Ltr
            of water.Use mulching to minimize temperature effect. For good flowering and yield, spray 00:52:34 @150 gm/15 Ltr of water twice at 8 days interval when flowering starts. It will prevent flower drop also.



            <div>
                <h3>WEED CONTROL</h3>
                Weeding and earthing up should be done around newly planted crop. Intercrop can be taken till plant gets well acquainted to surrounding atmosphere upto plant start bearing. Depending upon variety it will take 5-6years. Intercropping helps to minimize
                weed control. Leguminous crop like moong, mash, gram and Lentil can be taken as intercrop. Also crop like onion, tomato, Radish, beans, cauliflower, cabbage are useful for intercropping. Avoid Bajra, maize and sugarcane as intercropped.
            </div>
            <div class="content-crops">
                <h3>IRRIGATION</h3>
                Amount and interval of irrigation depend upon, type of soil, climate and source of irrigation. To young plant apply light and frequent irrigation. Light irrigation always give best results as compared to flood irrigation. In summer apply irrigation at
                interval of 5-7days where as in winter slowly increased irrigation interval to 25-30days. In rainy season, apply irrigation depending upon rainfall intensity. Bearing trees required irrigation during fruit development period at interval
                of 10-12days. After fertilizer application in February month give light irrigation.
            </div>
            <div class="content-crops">
                <h3>HARVESTING</h3>
                Changing of fruit color is sign of fruit maturity. It usually required 15-16week after fruits set to get mature. Pick individual fruits with help of ladder or bamboo having sharp knife and having net to collect harvested fruits. Avoid falling of fruits
                on ground as it will damage fruits during storage. After harvesting, do sorting and grading of fruits according to size, color and then packed in boxes. Place harvested fruits on polynet upside down.
            </div>
            <div class="content-crops">
                <h3>POST-HARVESTING</h3>
                After harvesting dip fruits in water. Reject immature fruits which float on water. After that place fruits in 25gm/Ltr salt water. Fruits which float in salt water are mainly used for export. According to prevention of Food adulteration act (1954) ripening
                of any food by using Carbide gas is a crime. For uniform ripening of fruits , dip 100kg fruits in 100Ltr of water containing (62.5ml-187.5ml) Ethrel at 52±2°C for 5min within 4-8 days after harvesting. For fruit fly detection in export
                quality fruits VHT (vapor heat treatment) is compulsory. For this process use 3days prior harvested fruits.
