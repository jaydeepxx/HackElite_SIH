            <h4>Time of sowing </h4>
            In uttarpradesh planting is done in spring season (February to March) and Monsoon season (15 August to October end).<br>

            <h4> Spacing</h4>
            For sweet oranges use spacing of 5mx5m is recommended. Dig pit of 1mx1mx1m, kept open in sun for some days. Add 15-20kg of well decomposed cow dung, SSP@500gm per Pit..</div>

        <div class="content-crops">
            <h4>Sowing Depth</h4>
            Pits of size 60×60×60cm should be dug for planting seedlings.
            <h4>Method of sowing</h4>
            <h4>Propagation</h4>
            Orange can be propagated either by Seed or By Budding.<br>

            <h4>Seed Propagation</h4>
            Fruits from healthy plants with high density are selected for extracting seeds. Seeds should be mixed with ash and are left in the shade to dry. To prevent seed viability, they should be sown immediately at a distance of 3-4cm. Germination may take 3-4
            weeks. Unhealthy seedlings should be removed from the field. Proper care must be taken to protect the seedlings from various diseases and insect-pests.<br>

            <h4>Budding</h4>
            Sow citrus seeds in nursery on bed of 2mx1m size and with 15cm distance between the rows. When seedlings are of 10-12cm height, transplanting is to be done. Select healthy and uniform size seedling for transplantation purpose. Remove dwarf and weak seedlings.
            If needed, pruned roots slightly before planting. In nursery, Budding is done when plant are of pencil thickness. Shield budding or T shape budding is done for that, T shaped slot is made in bark of tree at distance of 15-20cm from ground.
            Horizontal cut of about 1.5-2cm long is given, and vertical cut of 2.5cm long is made from middle of horizontal cut. Remove bud from bud stick and insert it into T shape slots, afterward wrapped it with plastic paper. T budding is done during
            February-March and also in August- September. Propagation in sweet orange, kinnow, grape fruit is done by T budding while For lime and Lemon, it is propagated by Air layering method.<br>

            <h3>FERTILIZER</h3>


            Fertilizer requirement (gm/tree) Age of crop (Year) Urea SSP First to three year 240-720 - Four to Seven 960-1680 1375-2400 Eight and above 1920 2750 Nutrient requirement (gm/tree) Age of crop (Year) Nitrogen Phosphorus First to three year 110-130 - Four
            to Seven 440-770 220-385 Eight and above 880 2750 For Orange crop: For 1-3year old crop, apply well decomposed cowdung@10-30kg, Urea@240-720gm per tree. For 4-7year old crop, apply well decomposed cow dung@40-80kg, Urea@960-1680gm and SSP@1375-2400gm
            per tree. For eight years and above crop, apply cowdung@100kg, Urea@1920gm and SSP@2750gm per Tree. Apply whole amount of cow dung during December month whereas apply Urea in two parts, apply first of Urea in February, and second dose in April-May
            month. At time of applying first dose of Urea, apply whole dose of SSP fertilizer. If fruit drop is observed, to control excessive fruit drop, take spray of 2,4-D@10gm in 500Ltr of water. Take first spray in March end, then in April end. Repeat
            the spray in August and September end. If cotton is planted in nearby field of citrus, avoid spraying of 2, 4-D, instead take spray of GA3.

            <h3>WEED CONTROL</h3>
            Weed can be controlled by hand-hoeing and also controlled by chemically, use glyphosate@1.6litre per 150 litre of water. Use glyphosate only on weeds not on crop plants.
        </div>
        <div class="content-crops">
            <h3>IRRIGATION</h3>
            Amount and interval of irrigation depend upon, type of soil, climate and source of irrigation. To young plant apply light and frequent irrigation. Light irrigation always give best results as compared to flood irrigation. In summer apply irrigation at
            interval of 5-7days where as in winter slowly increased irrigation interval to 25-30days. In rainy season, apply irrigation depending upon rainfall intensity. Bearing trees required irrigation during fruit development period at interval of
            10-12days. After fertilizer application in February month give light irrigation.

            <h3>HARVESTING</h3>
            On attaining proper size, shape along with attractive color having TSS to Acid ratio of 12:1, kinnow fruits is ready for harvest. Depending upon variety fruits are generally ready for harvesting in Mid- January to Mid- February. Do harvesting at proper
            time as too early or too late harvesting will give poor quality
        </div>
        <div class="content-crops">
            <h3>POST-HARVESTING</h3>
            After harvesting, wash fruits with clean water then dip fruits in Chlorinated water@2.5ml per Liter water. Then partially dried them. To improve appearance along with to maintain good quality, do Citrashine wax coating along with foam. Then these fruits
            are dried under shade and then packing is done. Fruits are packed in boxes.
