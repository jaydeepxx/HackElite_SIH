        <div class="heading1">GENERAL INFORMATION</div>
        Sugarcane, Saccharum officinarum L. is a perennial gras. It belongs to bamboo family and it is indigenous to
        India. It is the main source of sugar, jaggery and khandsari. About two-thirds of the total sugarcane produced
        in India is consumed for making jaggery and khandsari and only one third of it goes to sugar factories. It also
        provides raw material for manufacturing alcohol. Brazil is largest producer of sugarcane followed by India,
        China, Thailand, Pakistan and Mexico. In India, Maharashtra is largest producer of sugar and it contributes
        about 34% of sugar in country followed by Uttar Pradesh.

        <div class="heading1"> LAND PREPARATION</div>
        Give two ploughings to land. First ploughing should be given at depth of 20-25 cm. Crush clods with suitable
        implements or machine.
        <div class="heading1">SOWING</div>
        <div class="heading2">Spacing</div>
        Row spacing is ranges from 60-120 cm for sub-tropical regions.
        <div class="heading2">Sowing Depth</div>
        Sow the sugarcane at depth of 3-4 cm and cover it with soil.
        <div class="heading2">Method of sowing</div>
        A) For sowing use improved method of planting like deep furrow, trench method, paired row method or ring pit
        method.
        <br>
        1) Dry planting in ridges and furrow: With the help of tractor drawn ridger, make ridges and furrows at
        distance
        of 90 cm. Plant sugarcane setts then cover it with soil. After then give light irrigation.
        <br>
        2) Paired row planting: Make Trenches at 150 cm distance using trenches opener. Plant sugarcane in paired
        row
        using 30:30-90-30:30cm spacing. It gives higher yield as compared to ridges and furrow.
        <br>
        3) Ring Pit method: Circular pits of 60 cm diameters are dug at depth of 30 cm with a tractor mounted
        digger. 60
        cm gap is provided between adjacent pits. 2-3 ratoons can be taken. 25-50% higher yield can be obtained
        compared
        to ridge and furrow.
        <br>
        B) Single budded set planting: Select healthy setts for plantation. Make furrows at distance of 75-90 cm.
        Place
        single budded setts. If only small size setts from top portion of cane are selected then they are planted at
        distance of 6"-9". Place eye of sett on upward direction to ensure proper and quick germination. Cover setts
        with soil and apply light irrigation
        <div class="heading2">Seed Rate</div>

        Various research and experiment shows that, germination percentage of 3 bud sets is higher than the setts
        having
        <br>
        more or less than three buds. Germination percentage of single bud sett is very low because of moisture loss
        from other cut end. Also if whole can stalk is planted without giving any cut, still germination percentage
        remain low as only top end will get germinate.
        <br>
        Seed rate vary from region to region. In North West India, seed rate is high because of low germination
        percentage and adverse weather i.e hot weather with desiccating winds. Use seed rate of 20,000 three budded
        setts per acre.


        <div class="heading2">Seed Treatment</div>
        Take seed material from crop of 6-7 months age. It should be free from pest and disease. Discard pest,
        disease
        affected and damaged buds and canes. Harvest seed crop one day before planting, it will give high and
        uniform
        germination. The setts should be soaked in Carbendazim@3gm in 1litre of water. After chemical treatment
        treat
        with Azospirillum. For that dip setts in Azospirillum inoculum@800gm/acre +sufficient water solution for
        15min
        before planting.

        <div class="heading2">Soil Treatment</div>
        Suspended 5 kg of bio fertilizer per acre in 10 litres of water & mixed with thoroughly with 80-100 kg of
        FYM.
        The mixed bio fertilizer in FYM is sprinkled over cane setts in the rows of planting. Immediately rows
        should be covered.

        <div class="heading1">FERTILIZER</div>
        Fertilizer Requirement (kg/acre)
        UREA SSP MURIATE OF POTASH ZINC 200 As per soil test As per soil test #
        Nutrient Requirement (kg/acre)
        NITROGEN PHOSPHORUS POTASH
        90 As per soil test As per soil test
        Soil testing after every three year is necessary to know actual need of fertilizer. Before sowing at time of
        last ploughing, add well decomposed cow dung@8ton or Vermicompost+ Ralligold@ 8-10kg or PSB@5-10kg per Acre.
        At time of sowing apply Urea@66kg per acre. At development stage, apply second dose of

        Urea@66kg at the time of second irrigation. Apply third dose of Urea@66kg at time of fourth irrigation.
        In winter due to low temperature uptake of nutrient by crop become less and plant give yellow appearance. To
        recovered crop take spray of 19:19:19@100gm/15Ltr of water. In water scarcity situation spray of
        Urea+Potash@2.5kg/100Ltr is helpful for crop.

        <div class="heading1">WEED CONTROL</div>
        In sugarcane due to weed infestation about 12 to 72% yield loss is observed depending upon severity. Initial
        60-120 days are critical for weed management. Therefore weed management practices should be adopt within 3-4
        months after planting. For control of weeds, chemical is not only solution. Adopting mechanical as well as
        cultural practices gives effective solution.
        <br>
        <div class="heading2">1) Mechanical Measure:</div> As sugarcane is widely space crop, weeding with hand or
        interculture operation can be
        easily carried out. Take 3-4 hoeing after every irrigation.
        <br>
        <div class="heading2">2) Cultural Operations:</div> It included change in cropping pattern, intercropping and
        trash mulching.
        Monocropping
        leads to heavy infestation of weed. Crop rotation with fodder or green manure crops suppress weeds. Also
        sugarcane is wider space crop so there is opportunity for weed to grow in large numbers. If sugarcane is
        intercrop with short duration crops then it will suppress the weed growth also give additional benefit. In
        trash
        mulching, mulch of 10-12cm thickness is provided in between cane row after emergence of cane. It will
        restrict
        the sunlight thus help to check weed growth. It also conserved soil moisture.
        <br>
        <div class="heading2"> 3) Chemical:</div> To control weeds, carry out pre-emergence weedicide application with
        Simazine or
        Atrazine@600-800
        g/acre or Metribuzine@ 800 g/acre or Diuron@1- 1.2 kg/acre. Apply pre- emergence herbicides immediately
        after
        <div class="heading2"> 4) Planting :</div> Apply 2,4-D@250-300 g/acre as post- emergence herbicide for
        broad-spectrum weed control in
        sugarcane.

        <div class="heading1">IRRIGATION</div>
        The number of irrigations required will depending upon soil type, water availability etc. The hot weather
        associated with dry winds and drought increases the water requirement of the crop.
        Apply first irrigation when 20-25% crops have germinated. In monsoon, apply irrigation depending upon
        rainfall
        intensity and frequency. In case of scanty rainfall apply irrigation with 10days interval. Afterwards
        increase
        irrigation intervals, i.e apply water with 20-25days interval. To conserved moisture in soil do mulching in
        between cane rows. Avoid water stress from April to June. Water stress during these days will reduce yield.
        Avoid water logging in standing field. Tillering stage and elongation or grand growth phase are critical for
        irrigation.
        Earthing: Soil between the furrows of canes, is taken with the help of spade and applied to the

        sides of the plants. It help to mix top dressed fertilizer well within the soil, also it help to support
        plant
        and prevent it from lodging.

        <div class="heading1">PLANT PROTECTION </div>
        <div class="heading2"> Pest and their control:</div>
        Early shoot borer: Attacked in germination stage upto internodes formations. Larva make holes in shoot below
        the
        ground level and then enter into it thus causes dead heart. It give offensive smell. It is mostly observed
        in
        light soil and in dry weather. Pest is active from March - June.
        Avoid late plantation. Apply Chlorpyriphos@1litres/acre with 100-150 litres of water over the setts placed
        on
        furrows with the help of rosecan. Remove dead heart infected plants. Give light irrigation and avoid drying
        of
        field.
        <div class="heading2">White Grub:</div> These feed on root system and thus damage to crop. Entire drying up of
        stalks and easily
        dislodging
        of cane are main symptoms for white grub infestation. In initial stage infestation observed in patches and
        afterwards it spread on entire field.
        The adult beetles emerge from the soil during June-July with the first showers of rain. They congregate on
        the
        nearby trees and feed on their leaves during night. The eggs are laid in the soil and the larvae (grubs)
        hatching from them eat away the rootlets or root hairs of the groundnut plants. To destroy beetles spray
        Imidacloprid@4-6ml/10Ltr of water on plants of nearby sugarcane plants.
        For effective management of white grub. Plough the field and exposes the beetles resting in the soil. Do not
        delay crop sowing. Before sowing treat cane with Chlorpyriphos. Apply Phorate@ 4kg or carbofuran@13kg per
        acre
        in the soil at or before sowing. In heavily infested fields, flooding is to be done for 48 hrs. Do drenching
        of
        Clothianidin@40gm/acre with 400 Ltr of water using cane.

        <div class="heading2">Termites:</div> Before sowing do cane treatment. Dip setts in imidacloprid
        solution@4ml/10Ltr for 2min or at time
        planting spray Chlorpyriphos@2litre/acre on setts. If infestation occur in standing crop, drench with
        Imidacloprid@60ml/150litre of water or Chlorpyriphos@1ltr/200Ltr of water.
        <div class="heading2">pyrilla :</div> Severe pest of North India. Adult suck leaf sap under the surface of
        leaves. It results in
        yellowing
        white spot and withering. They secretes honey like substance and attract sooty mould fungi, due to this
        leaves
        become blackish.
        At regular interval, collect and destroy white-puffy egg masses. In severe infestation spray with Dimethoate or
        Acephate@ 1-1.5ml/Ltr of water.
        <div class="heading2">Root borer:</div> Borer enter into root zone of shoot below ground. Infestation is high
        from July onward. Due to
        infestation yellowing of leaves from leaf apex to downwards along the margin is seen.
        Before sowing do cane treatment with Chlorpyriphos. In dry field infestation is low so keep field dry and
        clean,
        avoid water logging condition in field. Carry out earthing operation at 90days. If infestation is observed
        in field, do drenching with Chlorpyriphos 20EC@1Ltr/acre with 100-150Ltr of water near the root zone or do
        granular application of Quinalphos@300ml/acre. Remove infected cane and destroyed it away from field.

        <div class="heading2">Stalk Borer:</div> It is active from July onwards with onset of monsoon. Larvae feeds on
        inner surface of leaf
        sheath,
        mid rib and stalk. It can attack any region of stalk. Infestation continues from cane formation to harvest.
        Avoid excess use of nitrogen, keep field clean and provide proper drainage. Provide earthing up to prevent
        crop
        from lodging. Chemical control is rarely effective. Release parasitoid, Cotesia flavipes@800 mated
        females/acre
        at weekly interval from July to November.
        Top Borer: It attacks crops from tillering to maturity phase. Larvae makes tunnels into midribs causes white
        streak which later turns brown. If infestation occurs during tillering phase, the attacked shoots dies
        resulting
        in dead heart formation. If it attacks on grown up canes, apical growth is arrested resulting in bunchy top
        symptoms.
        To control do drenching of Rynaxypyr 20SC@60ml/acre in 100-150Ltr of water in between period of month end of
        April to first week of May. Maintain proper drainage in soil, as water logging increases top borer
        incidence.
        <div class="heading2">⦁ Disease and their control:</div>

        <div class="heading2">Red Rot:</div> From top, third and fourth leaves show yellowing and drying. At later stage
        show discoloured lesion
        on
        rind. If split the diseased stalk show reddening of internal tissue. A sour and alcoholic smell emanates
        from
        the infected cane.
        To control grow disease resistance varieties. Select disease free cane for sowing. Discard cane which show
        reddening at cut end and at the nodal region. Do crop rotation with paddy or with green manure crops. Avoid
        water logging field. If infestation is observed remove the crop and destroyed it away from field. Disinfect
        soil
        around the diseased clump with Carbendazim@0.1% solution.
        <div class="heading2">Wilt:</div> Root borer, nematodes, termite, drought and water logging condition cause
        plant to wilt infection.
        Crown
        leaves turn yellow and loose turgor and withers. Boat shape cavities appears in pith region and crop get
        shrink.
        It reduces germination and reduces yield.
        Use disease free setts for planting. Do setts treatments with Carbendazim@0.2% + Boric acid@ 0.2% for 10min.
        Intercropping with onion, garlic and coriander will reduces the wilt disease.
        Pokkah Boeng: It is air borne disease. Symptoms are observed in monsoon. Disease plant bear distorted and
        wrinkled leaves. Leaves show reddish patches at base of leaf blade. Newly formed leaves become shortened and
        sword like.
        Grow pokkah boeng disease resistive varieties. If infection of disease is observed spray with
        Carbendazim@4gm/Ltr or Copper Oxychloride@3gm/Ltr or Mancozeb@3gm/Ltr of water.

        <div class="heading1">HARVESTING</div>
        Harvesting of cane at right time is necessary for good yield and for high sugar recovery. Harvesting at over
        aged or under aged cane leads to loss in cane yield. Depending upon withering of leaves and cane juice,
        harvesting time can be decided. To know the right harvesting time some farmer used hand sugar refractometer
        is
        used. Sickles are used for harvesting. Stalks are cut at ground level so that the bottom sugar rich
        internodes
        are harvested which add to yield and sugar. De-topping at appropriate height. After harvesting quick
        disposal of
        the harvested cane to factory is necessary.

        <div class="heading1">POST-HARVEST</div>
        Sugarcane provides a juice, which is used for making white sugar, and jaggery (gur) and many by products
        like
        bagasse and molasses.
