        <div class="heading1">LAND PREPARATION</div>
        Do ploughing, cross ploughing of land and then levelled the land. Prepare land in such way that water
        stagnation
        should not occurred in field.

        <div class="heading2">Time of sowing</div>
        February-March or August-September month is optimum time for planting of Guava.
        <div class="heading2">Spacing</div>
        For planting use spacing of 6x5 m. Use of planting distance of 7m, then in square system, 132 plants can
        be accommodating in one acre.
        <div class="heading2">Sowing Depth</div>

        <div class="heading1">PROPAGATION</div>
        Plants are propagated by budding or Air layering. Sardar variety seeds are tolerant to wilt and can
        be used for raising rootstock. Extract seed from ripen fruit and sow them in raise bed in August-March. Make
        raised beds of 2mx1m. When seedling becomes six months old they are ready for transplantation. Transplanted
        seedling when attain diameter of 1-1.2cm and height of 15cm they are ready for budding process. May and June
        months are best for budding process. Freshly cut, angular bud wood from current season’s growth is used for
        budding purpose

        <div class="heading1">PRUNING AND TRAINING</div>
        Training and Pruning is necessary to provide stronger frame work to guava tree. Stronger frame
        work helps to
        support high yield. To maintain the productivity of trees, light pruning at time of first
        harvesting is
        necessary. Regularly remove dead and diseased infected branches. Modified leader system of
        training is
        followed.
        Flowers in guava are borne on current seasons growth so carry out light annual pruning and
        remove upto 10cm
        tip,
        it will encourage new shoots after harvestig FERTILIZER

        <div class="heading1">WEED CONTROL</div>
        Weed control is necessary for good crop growth and yield. To keep check on weed growth,
        apply Gramoxone
        6ml/litre of water in March, July and September month. Apply Glyphosate@ 1.6Ltr/acre as
        post-emergence when
        weed
        growth is active (before weeds flower and attained height of 15-20cm). 200Ltr of water
        is sufficient to
        spray
        one acre land.
        <div class="heading1">IRRIGATION</div>
        After planting, irrigate crop immediately, then irrigate on third day, afterwards
        irrigate depending upon
        soil
        type and climate. Irrigation is not required to well establish orchards. Young
        plantation required
        irrigation at
        weekly interval in summer month and 2-3 irrigation during winter month. Avoid flood
        irrigation during
        flowering
        stage as it leads to excessive flower

        <div class="heading1">PLANT PROTECTION</div>
        <div class="heading2">Fruit Fly:</div> It is serious pest of guava. Females lay eggs below epidermis of
        young fruits. Later on maggots
        feed
        on pulp afterward fruits starts rotting and get drop.
        If orchards are having history of fruit fly, avoid taking rainy season crop. Do
        harvesting at right time.
        Avoid
        delay in harvesting. Remove and destroyed infested branches, fruits away from
        field. Take spray of
        Fenvalerate@80ml in 150Ltr of water at weekly intervals on fruit ripening.
        Harvest should be done after
        third
        day of spraying.
        <div class="heading2">Mealy Bug:</div> They suck sap from different plant parts and thus weaken plant. If
        infestations of sucking pests
        like
        Mealy bug is observed then to control spray with Chlorpyriphos 50EC @
        300ml/100Ltr of water.
        Guava Shoot Borer: It is a serious pest of nursery. Infested shoots get dry up.
        If infestation is observed, take spray of Chlorpyriphos@500ml or
        Quinalphos@400ml in 100Litres of water per
        acre.
        5

        <div class="heading2">Aphid:</div> Serious and common pest of Guava. Adult and nymphs, both suck the sap
        thus weaken the plant. In
        severe
        infestation, they cause curling and deformation of young leaves. They secrete
        honey dew like substance and
        Sooty, black mould is developed on affected parts.
        If infestation is observed to control takes spray of Dimethoate@20ml or Methyl
        Demeton@ 20ml per 10Ltr water
        on
        new flush.
        <div class="heading2"> Wilt:</div> Serious disease of Guava crop. Yellowing, wilting of leaves along with
        defoliation are symptoms of
        wilt
        infestation.
        Keep field well drained; avoid water logging condition in field. Remove and
        destroyed infected plants away
        from
        field. Drench nearby soil with Copper oxychloride@25gm or Carbendazim@
        20gm/10Ltr of water
        <div class="heading2">Anthracnose or Dieback:</div> Dark brown or black spots are observed on shoots. On
        fruits also small, raise, dark
        spots are observed. Fruits rot completely within 2 to 3days after infection.
        Keep field clean, destroyed infected plant parts, fruits also avoid water
        logging condition in soil. After
        pruning take spray of Captan@300gm in 100Ltr water. At fruit set repeat the
        spray of Captan and continue
        till
        fruits get mature with interval of 10-15days. If infestation observed in field
        take spray of Copper
        oxychloride@30gm/10Ltr on infected trees.

        <div class="heading1">HARVESTING</div>
        Within 2-3years after planting comes to bearing. Harvesting should be done
        when fruits get mature. On
        maturity,
        fruits changes color from dark green to greenish yellow. Do harvesting at
        proper time and avoid
        over-ripening of
        fruits as it deteriorates quality and test.
        <div class="heading1">POST-HARVEST</div>
        After harvesting, carry out cleaning, grading and packing operations. As
        gauva is perishable fruits, it
        should
        be marketed immediately after harvest. For packing use CFB, corrugated
        fibre boxes or bamboo baskets of
        different size.
