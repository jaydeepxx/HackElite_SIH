        <div class="heading1">GENERAL INFORMATION</div>
        Watermelon is originated in South Africa. It is an important cucurbitaceous vegetable in India. It is an
        excellent desert fruit and its juice contain 92% water along with proteins, minerals and carbohydrates. In
        Japan, cubic shape watermelon are popular, they grow watermelon in glass box and give cubic shape. Watermelons
        are mainly cultivated in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar
        Pradesh.
        <div class="heading1">CLIMATE</div>
        Temperature
        20-30°C
        Rainfall
        50-75mm
        Harvesting Temperature 25-30°C
        Sowing Temperature 20-25°C
        <div class="heading1">SOIL</div>
        Watermelon grows well in deep fertile and well-drained soil. It gives best result when grown on sandy or sandy
        loam soil. Soil having poor drainage capacity is not suited for watermelon
        1
        cultivation. Follow crop rotation as continuous growing of same crop on same field leads loss of nutrients, poor
        yield and more disease attack. pH of soil should be in between 6-7.
        <div class="heading1">POPULAR VARIETIES WITH THEIR YIELD</div>

        <div class="heading1">LAND PREPARATION</div>
        Plough land and bring to fine tilth. In North India, sowing is done February - March month. In North east and
        west India sowing is done during November to January. Watermelon can be direct seeded or transplant in nursery
        and then transplanted to main field.
        <div class="heading1">SOWING</div>
        Time of sowing
        In north it is sown during middle of January to March and in November to December.
        Spacing
        Depending upon sowing method spacing may get vary. In pit method use row to row spacing of
        2

        2-3.5m and 60 cm between two plant. Sowing Depth
        Plant seed about 2-3cm deep. Method of sowing
        For sowing different methods of planting like furrow method, Pit method and hill method can be used depending
        upon climate and season.
        Furrow Method: Sowing is done on either side of furrows. Sow 3-4 seeds (After germination keep only healthy
        seedling) at a time and keep plant to plant distance of 60-90cm.
        Pit Method: Sow 4 seeds in pit. For that make pit of 60x60x60cm at distance of 2-3.5m between two rows and
        0.6-1.2m between plants. Fill pit with well decomposed cow dung and soil. After germination keep only one
        seedling.
        hill method: Similar to pit method. In this, pit of 30x30x30cm pits are made at distance of 1-1.5m. Two seeds
        are sown per hill.
        3

        <div class="heading1">SEED</div>
        Seed Rate
        For sowing one acre land, seed rate of 1.5 to 2 kg is required.
        Seed Treatment
        Before sowing treat seed with Carbendazim@2gm/kg of seeds. After chemical treat seeds with Trichoderma
        viride@4gm per kg of seeds. Dry seeds in shade and then do sowing immediately.
        <div class="heading1">FERTILIZER</div>
        Fertilizer Requirement (kg/acre) UREA SSP MURIATE OF POTASH 55 100 25
        Nutrient Requirement (kg/acre) NITROGEN PHOSPHORUS POTASH 25 16 15
        Apply Farm Yard Manure or well decomposed cowdung@8-10tonnes per acre. Apply Nitrogen@25kg, Phosphorus@16kg and
        Potash@15kg in form of Urea@55kg, Single Super Phosphate@100kg and Muriate of Potash@25kg per acre. Apply whole
        amount of Phosphorus, Potash and one third amount of Nitrogen before sowing seed. Apply remaining dose of
        Nitrogen near vines base, avoid touching it and mixed well in soil during initial growth period.
        When crop is of 10-15 days old, for good growth of crop along with good quality, take spray of
        19:19:19+Micro-nutrients@ 2-3gm/Ltr of water. Prevent flower drop and increase yield up to
        4

        10% take spray of Humic acid@3ml + MAP(12:61:00)@5gm/Ltr of water at flowering stage. Spray Salicylic Acid(4-5
        tabs of Aspirin Tablet 350mg)/15Ltr water at initial flowering, fruiting and maturity stage, One or two times
        with 30days interval. After 55days of sowing spray 13:00:45@100gm + Hexaconazole @250ml/150Ltr water for fast
        development of fruits and protection against powdery mildew. 65days after sowing to increase in fruit size,
        sweetness and colour take spray with 00:00:50 @1.5kg/acre using 100gm/15Ltr of water.
        <div class="heading1">WEED CONTROL</div>
        Keep bed weed free during early stage of growth. In absence of proper control measures, weed can cause yield
        loss of 30%. 15-20days after sowing carry out intercultural operations. Depending upon severity and intensity of
        weeds, two to three weeding are required.
        <div class="heading1">IRRIGATION</div>
        Apply irrigation, every week in summer season. At time of maturity give irrigation only when needed. Avoid over
        flooding in watermelon field. At time of applying irrigation, should not wet the vines or vegetative parts,
        especially during flowering and fruit-set. Avoid frequent irrigation in heavy soil as it will promote excessive
        vegetative growth. For better sweetness and flavour, stop irrigation or reduce watering 3-6days before
        harvesting.
        <div class="heading1">PLANT PROTECTION</div>
        Pest and their control:
        Aphid and Thrips: They suck the sap from the leaves resulting in yellowing and dropping of leaves. Thrips
        results in curling of leaves, leaves become cup shaped or curved upward.
        If infestation is observed in field, to control spray the crop with Thiamethoxam@5gm/15Ltr of water. If
        infestation of sucking pest and powdery/downy mildew is observed, take spray of Thiamethoxam and 15days after
        spraying, spray with Dimethoate@250ml+Tridemorph@ 100ml/200Ltr of water.
        Fruit fly: It is serious pest. Females lay eggs below epidermis of young fruits. Later on maggots feed on pulp
        afterward fruits starts rotting.Remove and destroyed infected fruits away from
        5

        field. If infestation is observed, at initial stage take spray of Neem seed kernal extracts@ 50gm/Ltr of water.
        Take spray of Malathion@300ml + Jaggery@100gm in 200litre of water 3-4times at 10 days interval.
        Anthracnose: Anthracnose affected foliage appears scorched appearance.
        As a preventive measure, treat seed with Carbendazim@2gm/kg of seed. If infestation is observed in field, take
        spray of Mancozeb@400gm or Carbendazim@400gm/200liter of water.
        Powdery Mildew: Patchy, white powdery growth appears on upper surface of leaves also on main stem of infected
        plant. It parasitizes the plant using it as a food source. In severe infestation it causes defoliation and
        premature fruit ripening.
        If infestation is observed take spray of water soluble Sulphur@20gm/10Ltr of water 2-3 times with interval of 10
        days.
        Sudden wilt: It can affect crop at any stage. Plant get weak and give yellow appearance at initial stage, in
        severe infestation complete wilting is observed.Avoid water logging in field. Destroy
        6

        infected parts away from field. Apply Trichoderma Viride@1kg/acre mixed with 20kg FYM or Well decomposed
        Cowdung. If infestation is observed, take spray of Mancozeb or Copper Oxychloride@400gm/200liter or Carbendazim
        or Thiophanate-methyl@200gm/200liter of water.
        Leaf Miner: Maggots of leaf miner feed on leaf and make serpentine mines into leaf. It affects the
        photosynthesis and fruit formation.
        If infestation of leaf miner is observed, spray of Abamectin@6ml/15Ltr of water should be done to get rid of
        leaf miner.
        <div class="heading1">HARVESTING</div>
        If tendril near stem gets dried also whitish color of fruit which touch to ground get yellowish then assume that
        fruit is ready for harvesting. On thumping melon if it sounds hollow (usually as a dull thump or thud) then it
        is ready for harvest and immature fruit sounds dense. Dont pick immature fruits as they ripe only when attached
        to vine. Immature fruit don’t have rich sugar content or color. To harvest ripe fruit, cut stem 1" from fruit
        with a pair of sharp pruners or knife. Fruit can be stored in a cool humid environment.
        <div class="heading1">POST-HARVEST</div>
        Grading is done on basis of size of fruit. It can be store for 14 days at temperature of 15°C. Do not store
        watermelon with apples and banana as it developed off flavor along with softening of fruit.
