        area is about 1/10 of the area
        to be transplanted. Broadcast Pre-germinated seeds on puddled and levelled soil. Keep the beds moist for the
        first few days. Do not flood the beds. When the seedlings are about 2 cm high, keep the beds submerged in a
        shallow layer of water. Apply dose of 26 kg/acre Urea about a fortnight after sowing. For transplantation use
        seedlings of 15-21 days or when seedlings are 25-30 cm long. Regularly irrigated the nursery.
        <div class="heading2">Dry Bed:</div> It is prepared in dry soil condition. Total seed bed area is about 1/10 of
        the area to be transplanted.
        Make seed bed of convenient dimensions with the soil raised at height of 6-10 cm. Spread half burned rice husk
        on these beds for easy uprooting. Irrigation should be done properly because less moisture can damage seedling.
        Incorporate basal fertilizer for proper nutrients.
        <div class="heading2">Modified Mat nursery:</div> This is the modified method of nursery making which require
        less space and less quantity

        about 1% of the transplantable land. Establishing seedlings in 4 cm layer of soil mix, arranged on a firm
        surface. Make 1 meter wide and 20-30 meter long plot and spread plastic sheet or banana leaves on it. Place a
        wooden frame with 4 cm deep and then fill the frame with soil mixture. Sow pre-germinated seed in it and cover
        the seed with dry soil. Immediately sprinkle water on it. Irrigate frame as and when needed and keep it moist.
        Seedlings are ready for transplanting within 11 to 14 days of sowing. Transport seedling mat to field and
        separate them and transplant 1-2 seedlings at 20x20 cm or 25x25 cm spacing.
        <div class="heading2">Depth of planting:</div> The seedlings should be transplanted at 2 to 3 cm depth. Shallow
        planting gives better
        yields.
        <div class="heading1">Method of Transplanting</div>

        <div class="heading2">1) Flat puddled transplanting:</div> Transplant seedlings in line at 20x15 cm for normal
        and 15x15 cm for late
        transplanting. Put 2 seedlings per hill and the seedlings should be transplanted upright and about 2-3 cm deep.
        <div class="heading2">2) Bed Transplanting:</div> Transplant seedlings on middle of slopes of bed. These bed are
        prepared by wheat bed
        planter in heavy soil. Before transplanting irrigate the furrows, then transplant seedlings by maintaining a

        irrigation in field. Depth of standing water should not exceed 10 cm. While doing intercultural and weeding
        operation, drain out excess water from field and irrigate field after completion of this operations. Stop
        irrigation about a fortnight before maturity to facilitate easy harvesting.

        <div class="heading2">• Pest and their control:</div>
        <div class="heading2">Root Weevil:</div> The presence of root weevil can be detected by the root and leave
        damage of yield. These are white
        legless grub feeds mainly on root. Plant gives yellow appearance, growth gets stunted and few tillers are form.
        If incidence is observed apply Carbaryl (4G)@10 kg either Phorate (10 G)@4 kg or Carbofuran (3 G) @10 kg per
        acre.
        <div class="heading2">Plant Hoppers:</div> These mainly occur in the irrigated wetland conditions or in rainfed
        areas. The presence of pest
        shows the browning of the yield, sooty moulds and honeydew present in bases where infected.
        If incidence is observed to control, spray with Dichlorvos @ 126 ml or 400 gm Carbaryl in 250 Ltr of water per
        acre or Imidacloprid @ 40 ml or Quinalphos 25 EC @ 400 ml or Chlorpyriphos @1 Ltr in 100 ltrs of water per acre.

            <img src="images/plant_hopper.png" alt="" srcset="">
        </div>
        <div class="heading2">Leaf folder:</div> This pest develops in high humidity and specifically found where rice
        is fertilized heavily. Larva
        fold the leaves and eat the plant tissue and produces white streaks.
        Control: If infestation is observed spray crop with Cartap hydrochloride @ 170 gm or Triazophos @350 ml or
        Chlorpyriphos @1 Ltr in 100 Ltr of water per acre.
        <div class="heading2">Rice Hispa:</div> It is serious pest in some districts. Larva create tunnel into leaves
        and thus destroyed leaves by
        producing white streaks on leaves.
        If Infestation is observed in field, spray crop with Methyl Parathion@120 ml or Quinalphos 25 EC@400 ml or
        Chlorpyriphos @1 Ltr in 100 ltr of water per acre.
        <div class="heading2">Stem borer:</div> Larva bore into the stem and causes dead heart. The old ones produce
        empty ear heads which turn
        white.

        <div class="heading2">Control:</div> If infestation is observed in field take spray of Cartap hydrochloride @
        170 gm or Triazophos @ 350 ml
        or Chlorpyriphos @ 1 Ltr per 100 Ltr of water.
        <div class="heading2">• Disease and their control:</div>
        Blast: Due to blast disease, spindle shaped spots with greyish centre and brown margin observed on the leaves.
        Also give neck rot symptoms and panicles get fall over. Observed in areas having excessive use of Nitrogen.
        If infestation is observed, spray with Zineb@500 gm/acre in 200 Ltr of water.
        <div class="heading2">Karnal Bunt:</div> Few grains in panicle get affected first and part of grain gets
        converted into black powder. In
        severe condition whole panicle gets affected and black powder spread on leaves, grains etc.
        To control this disease, avoid excess use of Nitrogen. When crop is at 10% flowering stage, take spray of Tilt
        25 EC @200 ml/200 litre of water. Repeat the spray with interval of 10 days.

        <div class="heading2">Brown leaf spot: </div>It produces oval, eye-shaped spots with a conspicuous dark-brown
        dot in the centre and light
        brown margin. Spots are developed on grains also. In low nutrient soil, this attacked more.
        To keep check on this disease, give balance amount of nutrient. When crop is at boot stage take spray of
        Tebuconazole @ 200 ml or Propiconazole @200 ml in 200 Ltr of water. After 15 days repeat the spray.
        <div class="heading2">False smut:</div> This fungus developed large greenish velvety spore-balls on individual
        grains. In humid, high
        rainfall and cloudy conditions, chances of spread of disease are high. Excessive use of Nitrogen also increases
        intensity of attack.
        To control this disease spray with 500 gm Copper Oxychloride per acre in 200 Ltr of water at boot stage in crop.
        With interval of 10 days, take spray with Tilt 25 EC @ 200 ml/200 liters of water.
        Show More

        <div class="heading2">Sheath blight: </div>On leaf sheath, greyish lesion with purple margin is developed. Later
        these lesions get developed
        and enlarge. In severe condition, poor grain filling is observed. Avoid excess use of Nitrogen. Keep field
        clean.
        If incidence of disease is observed, spray crop with Tebuconazole or Tilt 25 EC@200 ml or Carbendazim 25% @200
        gm in 200 Ltrs of water per acre. Repeat the spray after 15 days interval.
        <div class="heading1">Harvesting</div>
        Reap the yield once the panicles are developing fully as well as the crops get changed significantly yellow. The
        yield is generally harvested manually by sickles or by blend harvester. The harvested crops, tied up into
        compact bundles, strike it against really hard surface to split the grains from straw, accompanied by winnowing.
        <div class="heading1">Post-Harvest</div>
        The post-harvest method includes some procedures which include the interval from harvest to utilization 1)
        harvesting 2) threshing 3) cleaning 4) drying 5) warehouse 6) milling then transport to the trade.
        Before the storage of grains to protect harvested stuff from pest and disease attack, mix 500 gm Neem seed dust
        with 10 Kg of seed. To protect stored grains from pests attacked Mix Malathion 50 EC@30 ml/3 Ltr of water. Spray
        for 1002meter storage area at every 15 days.
