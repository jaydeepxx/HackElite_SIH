            <h3>GENERAL INFORMATION</h3>

            Maize (Zea mays L) is second rated grain used collectively in form of foodstuff or fodder. Globally, maize is known as queen of cereals because it has highest genetic yield potential among the cereals. Grains provides food items which are consumed in
            the form of starch, corn flakes also glucose. It is also used as animal feed in poultry. Maize can be cultivated in any soil as they require less fertile soil and various chemicals. Moreover, it fetch less ripening span, 3 months, in comparison
            to paddy, which takes 145 days. By growing maize, farmers can easily shield the deteriorating grade of soil , preserve 90% of water and 70% of potency as compared with paddy and can make more profit than wheat and paddy,” reported by vice
            chancellor, Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana. It serves as basic raw material to thousands of industrial products like oil, starch, alcoholic beverages etc. Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, J & K and
            Punjab are major maize growing states. AP and Karnataka is major producer of maize in south.

            <h3>SOIL</h3>
            Fertile well-drained alluvial or simply red loams free of coarse elements and full off nitrogen are ideal soils for maize cultivation. Maize can be grown on wide range of soils including loamy sand to clay loam. Definitely depleted plains are effective
            suited to the cultivation, even though it grows up in various hilly zones equally. Soils with fine organic matter containing good water holding capacity with pH ranging from 5.5-7.5 are required to increase yield. Heavy clay soil is not suitable
            for cultivation. Soil test is necessary to know deficiency of any nutrient in the soil.

            <h3>SOWING </h3>
            <h4>Time of sowing </h4>
            Time of sowing In kharif season, crop is sown in month of May end to June corresponding with the onset of monsoon. Spring crops are sown during late February to end of march. Plantation of baby corn can be done all the year round, except December and
            January. Kharif and rabi season are best for sweet corn sowing.
        </div>

        <div class="content-crops">
            <h4> Spacing</h4>
            <p>To obtain higher yield along with resource-use efficiency, optimum plant spacing is the key factor. 1) For kharif maize : use spacing of 60x20 cm. 2) Sweet corn : use spacing of 60x20 cm spacing. 3) Baby corn: Use 60x20 cm or 60x15 cm spacing.
                4) Pop corn: Use 50x15 cm spacing. 5) Fodder: use spacing of 30x10 cm spacing</p>

        <div class="content-crops">
            <h3>Sowing Depth</h3>
            Seed should be sown at depth of 3-4 cm. For sweet corn cultivation keep depth of sowing to 2.5 cm.

            <h4>Method of sowing</h4>
            Sowing can be done manually by dibbling seeds or by mechanically with help of tractor drawn ridger seed drill
            <h4>Seed Rate</h4>
            Purpose, seed size, season, plant type, sowing method these factor affect seed rate. 1) For kharif maize : use seed rate of 8-10 kg/acre<br> 2) Sweet corn : use seed rate of 8 kg/acre<br> 3) Baby corn: 16 kg/acre seed rate.<br> 4) Pop corn:
            7 kg/acre seed rate.<br> 5) Fodder: 20 kg/acre seed rate.<br> Intercropping: Pea can be taken as intercrop in maize plant. For that take one row of pea between maize crops. In autumn sugarcane and maize can also be intercropped. Sow one row
            of maize plant after two row of sugarcane.

        <div class="content-crops">
            <h3>FERTILIZER</h3>


            Fertilizer Requirement (kg/acre) UREA DAP or SSP MURIATE OF POTASH ZINC 75-110 27-55 75-150 15-20 8 Nutrient value (kg/acre) NITROGEN PHOSPHORUS POTASH 35-50 12-24 8-12 (Apply fertilizer based on soil test result). Apply Super phosphate@75-150 kg, 75-110
            kg of Urea and 15-20 kg of Potash (apply only if soil show its deficiency) per acre maize crop. Apply whole amount of SSP and MOP and one third of Urea at time of sowing. Apply remaining dose of nitrogen at knee height stage and pre tasseling
            stage. Zinc and magnesium deficiency are common in maize crop. To overcome this deficiency, apply Znso4@8kg/acre as basal dose. Along with zinc and magnesium deficiency, iron deficiency is also observed. Due to this whole plant gives yellow
            appearance. To overcome this deficiency, apply micro-nutrients mixture@25/acre mixed with 25 kg of sand after sowing the maize seed.

            <div>
                <h3>WEED CONTROL</h3>


                Weeds are the serious problem in maize, particularly during kharif/monsoon season they competes with maize for nutrient and causes yield loss upto 35%. Therefore, timely weed management is needed for achieving higher yield. Take atleast one or two hand
                weeding in maize crop. First 20-25 days after sowing and second when on 40-45 days after sowing. If weed infestation is high, spray with Atrazine @500gm per 200 Ltr of water. After weeding, apply fertilizer as top dressing and carry out
                earthing up operation.

            </div>
            <div class="content-crops">
                <h3>IRRIGATION</h3>


                Apply irrigation immediately after sowing. Based upon soil type, on third or fourth day give lifesaving irrigation. In rainy season, if rain is satisfactory then it is not needed. Avoid water stagnation in early phase of crop and provide good drainage
                facility. Crop required less irrigation during early stage, 20 to 30 days after sowing afterwards it required irrigation once in a week. Seedling, knee height stage, flowering and grain feeling are the most sensitive stage for irrigation.
                Water stress at this stage cause huge loss in yield. In case of water scarcity, irrigate alternate furrow. It will save water also.

                <h3>DEFICIENCY AND THEIR REMIDY</h3>


                <H4>Zinc Deficiency</H4>
                mostly observed in areas having use of high yielding variety. Broad band of white-yellow along with reddish veins are appeared on each side of mid rib on second or third leaf from top of plant. To overcome zinc deficiency, apply Zinc Sulphate@10 kg/acre
                at time of sowing. If deficiency is observed in standing field, apply Zinc Sulphate and mixed with equal quantity of dry soils and apply along the rows.

                <H4>Magnesium Deficiency</H4>
                Common is maize crop. Mostly observed on leaves. Basel leaves give yellowish appearance between edge and veins of leaves. As a preventive measure foliar spray of Magnesium Sulphate@1kg/acre in maize.

                <H4>Iron Deficiency</H4>
                Whole plant give yellowish appearance. As a preventive measure for Iron deficiency, apply mixture of Micro-Nutrient@25 kg/acre along with sand@18 kg/acre after sowing of maize crop.

            <div class="content-crops">
                <h3>HARVESTING</h3>


                Harvesting should be done when cobs outer cover turns from green to white. The optimum time of harvesting maize is when the stalks have dried and moisture of grain as about 17-20%. Drying place or equipment should be dry, clean and disinfected.<br>

                <b>Sweet corn harvesting</b>: When crops come nears to maturity, examined a few ears daily to determine the time for the first picking. Corn is ready for harvest when the ear is full size for the variety, has a tight husk, and has somewhat
                dried silks. The kernels are fully developed and exude a milky liquid when punctured. Delay harvesting causes reduction in sugar content. Whether harvesting is done by hand or machine, sweet corn should be collected at night or early in
                the morning.,<br>

                <b>Baby corn</b>: Ears are harvested 45-50 days after emergence, when silks are 1-2 cm long (within 1-2 days after silk emergence). Harvesting is carried out in morning when temperature is low and moisture is high. The picking of baby
                corn should be done once in three days and generally 7-8 pickings are required depending on genotypes used.<br>

                <b> Pop corn</b>: Leave ears of popcorn on the plant for as long as possible. If the weather allows, leave them in the field until the husks are dry and papery.<br>
